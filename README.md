How to play the New Craps?
Two players take turns. You start with a balance of 100 dollars. You roll two dice each time and the sum ranges from 2 to 12. Before you roll, you bet. In the first roll, if you get 7 or 11, you win; if you get 2 or 12, you lose. If you get any other numbers, you need to keep rolling until you get the previous sum again, in which case you win or you get 7, in which case you lose. Under two scenarios, the game ends. (1) One player reaches the goal of 300 dollars and (2) One player runs out of money.
