================

Program 1
-------------------------

Enter a decimal number between 0 and 255, for example 22: 55

The binary represenation is: 00110111

Binary number 00110111 can be converted back the original decimal number 55

Program 2
-------------------------

Enter a decimal number between 0 and 255, for example 22: 255

The binary represenation of decimal 255 is 11111111

Binary number 11111111 can be converted back the original decimal number 255

The hexadecimal represenation of decimal 255 is FF

How to play the New Craps?
Two players take turns. You start with a balance of 100 dollars. You roll two dice each time and the sum ranges from 2 to 12. Before you roll, you bet. In the first roll, if you get 7 or 11, you win; if you get 2 or 12, you lose. If you get any other numbers, you need to keep rolling until you get the previous sum again, in which case you win or you get 7, in which case you lose. Under two scenarios, the game ends. (1) One player reaches the goal of 300 dollars and (2) One player runs out of money.

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
